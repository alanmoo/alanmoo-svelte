summary: Or, 'hyping myself up to start a new habit'
---

Ok, well not exactly. Perhaps it's that I want to be someone who is known for their writing. Though that doesn't quite hit the nail on the head either. Maybe it's that I want to share my thoughts and professional work to publicly demonstrate my experience and push my career (and the web) further. Yeah, that one sounds pretty good. It's on-brand, too: I know myself and I need to understand my goal if I want a habit to stick.

There's another, more immediate priority here too: The more time I spend in software development, the more the job becomes about writing English than it does about writing code. I should practice that part outside of my day job. I've also found myself regularly working in this web content space – leading the engineering team as we first built the current [Mozilla Foundation site](https://foundation.mozilla.org), then improving the performance of the [Policygenius content site](https://policygenius.com), and now as the technical owner of the [Carta marketing site](https://carta.com) – so it makes a lot of sense to have a body of work that's my own to experiment with.

One of the books I read this year was [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) (which put words to a lot of the patterns I've recognized in the past and is worth a read), so naturally I'm thinking about how to make writing a habit that will stick. I'm on a 660 day Duolingo streak and the fact that I can just spend a few minutes doing it every day really helps. I want writing to be the same. Two possible approaches come to mind:

- Write and post at least 100 words every day. This hits the ease but not the habit stacking
- Tie this to my subway commute (which I do 3 days/week). This is a pretty reasonable habit to stack it with, though I worry it's not consistent enough to make writing into a habit that takes hold.

I think I'll split the difference and aim to publish at least 100 words 5 days a week. This accounts for the busiest of days where I just can't find the time, while making it a mostly-daily habit. I'll add a field to my nightly habit-tracking note (which gets scraped into my [yearly goal tracking](https://alanmooiman.com/blog/personal-goal-tracking)). And of course, like any work, I'll need to reevaluate and adjust course based on what I find works.
