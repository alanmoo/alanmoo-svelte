				<h3 class="organization" id="Policygenius">
					<a href="https://www.policygenius.com">Policygenius</a> /
					<a href="https://zinnia.com">Zinnia</a>
				</h3>
				<h4 class="job_title">Senior Engineering Manager</h4>
				<span class="role_dates">August 2023-October 2023</span>
				<p>
					Following an acquisition of Policygenius by Zinnia, I was promoted to Senior Engineering
					Manager as part of the Policygenius performance review process and tapped to lead a team integrating engineers from both organizations and help bring best practices from each to the combined engineering organization. I laid the groundwork by shaping team processes, building alignment with stakeholders, and widening bottlenecks in the development process where possible. Once the team was established, I reflected on my own career and personal needs and recognized the time was right to take a few months off before searching for my next role.
				</p>
				<!-- <p>
					The most significant opportunities ahead of me involve leading the new team through the
					integration of engineering cultures. Historically, Zinnia has had an agency model where
					teams build what the customer asks for, while Policygenius has aimed for a generative
					culture in which engineers are empowered and encouraged to bring suggestions to the table
					that will improve the product they work on. As part of that integration work, the two
					goals I have in the short term are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Align the team on sustainable development workflows that lead to the team being more
						effective (as measured by metrics like DORA). The north star here is continuous
						deployment.
					</li>
					<li>
						Streamline team processes in order to reduce churn in the development process. This will
						primarily involve working with stakeholders to get engineers involved in the discovery
						process in order to derisk earlier than ticket estimation.
					</li>
				</ul> -->

				<h4 class="job_title">Engineering Manager</h4>
				<span class="role_Dates">September 2021 - July 2023</span>
				<p>
					At Policygenius I managed two teams. The first was Content/Lead Generation, which was
					responsible for the public <a href="https://policygenius.com">policygenius.com</a> content
					site and consumer education in our funnels. The second was Life Consumer, which focused on
					our life insurance sales funnel.
				</p>
				<p>Primary responsibilities included:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Working with my teams to set and achieve technical goals every quarter based on the
						impact they will have on the business
					</li>
					<li>Partnering with Product Managers to identify leads for upcoming projects</li>
					<li>
						Aligning with the scrum lead for each team to ensure the teams are effective and meeting
						their goals
					</li>
					<li>
						Coaching individual contributors engineers in their continued growth through occasional
						code review or pairing, as well as providing feedback in 1:1s on how they can improve
					</li>
					<li>Coaching a rising manager on the above skills</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					I guided my teams to prioritize the external user experience first, via performance
					(measured by Core Web Vitals/Lighthouse scores) and accessibility. Once we'd planned to
					optimize for the user, then we could focus on internal users and then finally the
					developer experience. Some accomplishments include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Due to architectrual changes my team spearheaded, Google now indexes new stories on the
						content site in one day rather than three.
					</li>
					<li>Total Blocking Time on the content site reduced by 50%</li>
					<li>
						After identifying a connection between funnel page speed and SEO, I led the charge on an
						engineering-wide culture shift to ensure we build for performance
					</li>
				</ul>

					Tech stack: React, Contentful, Gatsby/Gatsby Cloud, GraphQL, SpeedCurve, DataDog RUM,
					Jest/React Testing Library, Cypress, BuildKite, Storybook

				<h4 class="job_title">Web Engineering Manager</h4>
				<span class="role_dates">February 2020 - September 2021</span>
				<p>
					SquareFoot is a commercial real estate brokerage. I led the team of 4 engineers resposible
					for the front-end of their client acquisition platform, which was used for showing
					listings to potential clients, onboarding them into our sales flow, and then facilitating
					the broker/client search experience.
				</p>
				<p>Some significant accomplishments include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Leading my team in working on the quarterly key result of improving mobile Lighthouse
						scores for key SEO pages from in the 20's to 70's
					</li>
					<li>
						Proposing and driving a major upgrade on the web application's foundation and
						development workflow, which had core dependencies many years out of date (e.g. Node.js
						v6 when v13 was the most recent). From there, I championed migrating the main SEO pages
						to Next.JS, resulting in Lighthouse scores in the 90's, and improved rankings on Google
						Search.
					</li>
					<li>
						Spearheaded a successful transition of the team project management workflow. This was
						driven by a need for better asynchronous communications on a distributed team and to
						reduce time spent in planning meetings, while ensuring predictable project delivery.

				<p>
					I led a team of 6 web and devops engineers across North America and Germany, building
					projects to support Mozilla's mission of improving internet health. I worked closely with
					the design manager, product manager, and digital director to improve the Foundation's main
					site at foundation.mozilla.org. The design and engineering teams also functioned as a
					service organization internally. I partnered with the leaders of other teams to identify
					the best way for us to address their needs while pushing forward on our team's internal
					road map. I worked with my team to identify workflow challenges, improve their skills, and
					foster best software development practices while keeping us moving forward. Finally, as
					both the engineering lead and most senior technical manager in the org, I ensured
					organizational technology decisions were made prudently with an eye on long term impact
					and cost.

			<h2>Significant Projects</h2>

				<h3>Policygenius Content Site Improvements</h3>
				<p>
					Upon joining Policygenius to lead the Content Engineering team, I realized that the most
					clear element of my team's contributions toward business goals that fell entirely under
					our control was visitors' experience as measured via Core Web Vitals. These are known to
					have an impact on SEO, so I began coach my team in their regular product-driven work to
					improve performance wherever possible. Over the course of a year, we:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Created a vision for the team going forward, from which we built our technical plan
					</li>
					<li>
						Started collecting data on site performance with and without 3rd party scripts to
						monitor for changes under our control
					</li>
					<li>
						Migrated to Gatsby Cloud so that we could have efficient single-page content updates
						rather than a homespun approach that caused React to thrash on render and slow down site
						indexing
					</li>
					<li>
						Reduced TBT by over 50% with the continued migration of CSS-in-JS components to use CSS
						Modules
					</li>
					<li>
						Began improving performance of applications beyond the content site after the
						realization that non-indexed pages still have an influence on SEO
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="significant-project">
				<h3>SquareFoot Next.JS migration</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Recognized an opportunity to improve web performance, increase developer effectiveness,

						Experience search algorithm update went live
