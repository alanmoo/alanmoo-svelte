			<h2>Significant Projects</h2>
			<div class="significant-project">
				<h3>Policygenius Content Site Improvements</h3>
				<p>
					Upon joining Policygenius to lead the Content Engineering team, I realized that the most
					clear element of my team's contributions toward business goals that fell entirely under
					our control was visitors' experience as measured via Core Web Vitals. These are known to
					have an impact on SEO, so I began coach my team in their regular product-driven work to
					improve performance wherever possible. Over the course of a year, we:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Created a vision for the team going forward, from which we built our technical plan
					</li>
					<li>
						Started collecting data on site performance with and without 3rd party scripts to
						monitor for changes under our control
					</li>
					<li>
						Migrated to Gatsby Cloud so that we could have efficient single-page content updates
						rather than a homespun approach that caused React to thrash on render and slow down site
						indexing
					</li>
					<li>
						Reduced TBT by over 50% with the continued migration of CSS-in-JS components to use CSS
						Modules
					</li>
					<li>
						Began improving performance of applications beyond the content site after the
						realization that non-indexed pages still have an influence on SEO
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="significant-project">
				<h3>SquareFoot Next.JS migration</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Recognized an opportunity to improve web performance, increase developer effectiveness,
						and wrangle technical debt by moving from bespoke webpack configuration to standard
						Next.JS config
					</li>
					<li>
						Led the team in improving lighthouse scores from 20's to 70's, right as Google Page
						Experience search algorithm update went live
					</li>
					<li>
						Improved team's ability to work with a product manager on another continent via review
						applications
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="significant_project">
				<h3>Mozilla Donations platform</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Facilitated relationship with external contractors hired to rebuild our donations
						platform, which brings in millions of dollars per year.
					</li>
					<li>
						Acted as lead internal decision-maker for technology and implementation related details.
					</li>
					<li>
						Leveraged organizational and technological familiarity to ensure donor pipeline is
						optimized and collecting the right data to analyze for future improvement, while
						adhering to mission-driven privacy practices.
					</li>
					<li>Coordinated with CRM lead to ensure data flows as expected</li>

				<h3>Mozilla Foundation site</h3>
				<ul>

						Led a team of engineers to migrate <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org"
							>foundation.mozilla.org</a
						>
						from a partially static, partially CMS based site to one fully generated by a
						<a href="https://wagtail.io">Wagtail</a> instance
					</li>
					<li>
						Led team to significantly reduce challenges in reviewing/testing changes, improve
						deployment process, and modularize front-end
					</li>
					<li>
						Listened to the pulse of the organization to understand and direct feature development,
						meeting the needs of multiple stakeholders simultaneously
					</li>
					<li>
						Parlayed successful implementation into utilization of the platform for rapid build and
						deployment of <a href="https://mozillafestival.org">mozillafestival.org</a>
					</li>

			<div class="significant_project hide-print">
				<h3>E*Trade Portfolios Prototype</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Leveraged MongoDB, Express, NodeJS, and AngularJS to build a highly functional prototype
						for the new heart of the E*TRADE web platform
					</li>
					<li>
						Worked in conjunction with teammate building trade ticket to create fully functional
						experience for user testing
					</li>
					<li>
						Used Express and Node to design and RESTful API that could be utilized by AngularJS
						client side framework
