I'm currently on the search for a new job and I got tired of bouncing around between different job boards or career pages for companies I'm interested in working in. Instead, I built a tool to scrape them daily and present them all to me in a consolidated UI. It's a nice way to triage new roles and keep my technical skills fresh, while also giving me an excuse to play with different types of tech than I usually do. It's very much a work-in-progress but you can take a look at it [here](https://lassojobs.lol/)

July 2024 update: This helped me land my job at Carta!
