In July 2015 I spoke at [CascadiaJS](https://cascadiajs.com/) about the present and future of CSS, specifically how I expected CSS pre-processors would fade away as the web platform gained many of the features that made them popular.

<style>
  .video-container {
    aspect-ratio: 16/9;
    & iframe {
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
    }
  }
</style>
