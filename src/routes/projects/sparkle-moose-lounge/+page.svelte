<h1>Sparkle Moose Lounge</h1>
<p>In the fall of 2015, my partner and I decided we were moving out of New York City, and started looking at homes to buy in Portland, Maine. We looked at a bunch of places, amazed that we could buy something with multiple bedrooms. We took a trip up there one week to look at a bunch homes. While we thought NYC itself wasn't the right fit for us, there were certain elements of living there that we really enjoyed and couldn't quite find something that fit our needs. That was, until the last day when she finally convinced a seller to show us an under-construction space that was being converted from a second-floor restaurant into two new condo units.</p>

The courtyard is dug up, with a pile of bricks on top of some dirt. Next to the courtyard is a single-story brick structure, attached to the main building but with fake terra-cotta roofing. There are dining chairs piled up inside the window, showing it hasn't been used in a while.">

<p>It was raw, but we could see a vision for it.</p>
