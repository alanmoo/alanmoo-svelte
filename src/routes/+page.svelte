	<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm:</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>An advocate for an people first, accessible world, both online and offline</li>
		<li>
			An experienced engineering leader passionate about empowering individuals on my teams to
			develop their skills while building performant, standards-compliant web applications.
		</li>
		<li>
			Inclined to ship and iterate rather than let perfect be the enemy of good (see: this site
			design)
		</li>
		<li>
			Looking for my next role in Q1 2024! After an intentional break from work for a few months,
			I'm open to starting something new in the software engineering leadership space. Got something
			interesting? <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/amooiman">Let's connect</a>
