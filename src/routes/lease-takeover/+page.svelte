						This is a cozy 1 bedroom in an 8 year old rent-stabilized building across the street
						from Key Foods, at 497 St. Marks Ave. When you walk in you'll have the kitchen to the
						left, the living room in front of you, and the bathroom and bedroom on the left side of
						the living room. Pretty standard modern layout.
					</p>

					<p>
						Apartment pros:
						<br />- Dishwasher
						<br />- Fridge with bottom freezer
						<br />- Under-mount sink
						<br />- Good storage in kitchen
						<br />- Kitchen has view of living room
						<br />- Can't hear your neighbors
						<br />- Big bathroom (fits a litter box)
						<br />- Great shower
						<br />- Decent closets (1 bed, 1 coat)
						<br />- Queen bed fits in bedroom
						<br />- Heating and cooling work very well
					</p>

					<p>
						Apartment cons:
						<br />- It's a little on the smaller side, best for 1 person but do-able for two if
						you've got minimal stuff (previous tenants were a couple)
						<br />- North facing, so no direct light (but big 6th-floor windows get nice ambient
						daylight)
					</p>

					<p>
						The building:
						<br />- Elevator access from curb to apartment
						<br />- Gym in building, no amenity fee
						<br />- Laundry room in basement, I've never had to wait
						<br />- Free bike room in basement
						<br />- Paid parking on site
						<br />- Doorman 10AM-6PM to get packages
						<br />- Cat friendly
						<br />- Management is responsive
						<br />- Big roof
						<br />- Close to multiple grocery stores
						<br />- Close to Franklin Ave which has lots of great shops, walking distance to
						Vanderbilt too
						<br />- People seem to stay in the building so it has a neighborhood vibe
						<br />- A great warm-up walk to Prospect Park before a run

					<h3>About This Lister</h3>
					<p>
						Hello! I'm Cat (she/her), originally from NYC looking to move out of this lovely
						building in order to cohabitate with my partner (still in the neighborhood).
					</p>

					<p>
						Since I'll be moving in with my partner, I will not need all the furniture that's
						currently in the space. Up for sale would be a ladder desk, desk chair, sofa (2 people),
						dinner table &amp; chairs (4 people), vanity, large dresser, bedside table and rug. I've
						also got a cat tree that I would happily leave for free.
					</p>

					<p>
						This apartment is not handled by a broker, just me and I will not be making any
						money/commission off of the transfer.
					</p>

					<p>
						This all happened kind of by accident. I actually just renewed my lease in October, and
						was intending to stay another year when over the weekend we did the typical "let's see
						this building y'know, just for fun since we're in the neighborhood" NYC adventure. Low
						and behold, we found our dream home.
					</p>

					<p>
						All in all, I would love if this apartment could go to folk(s) who love the neighborhood
						and want an affordable and stable place to call home for hopefully many years.
					</p>

				<h3>Lister's Relationship to the Space</h3>
				<p>Current tenant</p>

				<h3>Rental requirements</h3>
				<p>
					You'll be working with the building management to sign a new lease. Pretty typical 40x
					rental requirements.
				</p>

				<p>
					Dates are slightly flexible; our new least starts December 15, so ideal takeover would be
					that weekend or soonafter.
				</p>

				<h3>Pets Policy</h3>
				<p>Cats allowed, building has a no dog policy.</p>
